An interesting distribution property we haven't yet discussed is **variability**. Consider, for instance, these two distributions of numerical values:\n","\n","\n","<img width=\"150\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1oLZvk-JGfbK9vrxSW3vOgyRKKGhWHHVN\">\n","\n","\n","The values of the distribution A don't vary — each value is 4. The values in distribution B  show some variability — they are not all identical, and the values can be either 8 or 0. **If we were to quantify variability**, we could assign a value of 0 to A to indicate that it has no variability. But **what variability value should we assign to distribution B?**\n","\n","We need a measure to summarize the **variability** of these two distributions. The summary metrics we've learned so far don't tell us anything about variability. The **mean**, the **median**, and the **mode** of distribution A are all 4, and distribution B has a **mean** and a **median** of 4, and **no mode**. If we were to judge variability based on these values, we'd probably have to conclude that the variabilities of the two distributions are equal, which is wrong.\n","\n","One intuitive way to measure the variability of a distribution is to find the **difference between the maximum and the minimum value**. Both the maximum and the minimum of distribution  A is 4, so the variability of distribution  is 0:\n","\n","$$\n","max(A) - min(A) = 4 - 4 = 0\n","$$\n","\n","We call this measure of variability the **range**. So the range of distribution A is 0. The range of distribution B  is 8:\n","\n","$$\n","max(B) - min(B) = 8 - 0 = 8\n","$$\n","\n","In more general terms, the range of distribution X, where  X can be any distribution of real numbers, is:\n","\n","$$\n","range(X) = max(X) - min(X)\n","$$\n","\n","\n","We'll continue working in this mission with the data set on house prices we used for the last three lessons.

Some sample standard deviations are lower than the population standard deviation, some are greater, some may even be equal to the population standard deviation, but on average the sample standard deviation is lower than the population standard deviation.\n","\n","We can get a good intuition for why the sample standard deviation underestimates if we think in terms of distribution spread. When we sample a population, it's generally more likely to get a sample with a spread that's lower than the population's spread. This generally translates to a lower standard standard deviation than in the population.\n","\n","<img width=\"600\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1DcLZ_g1qhY5CHg7IGj30U8y0beDDvMIW\">\n","\n","Getting a sample with a higher standard deviation than in the population is possible, but this is less likely.

One way to do that is to decrease the value of the denominator. For instance, in $\\frac{12}{6} = 2$, the denominator is 6. If we decrease the value of the denominator, we get a greater result: $\\frac{12}{4}=3$.\n","\n","We'll decrease by 1 the denominator in the sample standard deviation formula, which now becomes:\n","\n","\n","$$\n","SD_{sample} = \\sqrt{\\frac{(x_1 - \\overline{x})^2 + (x_2 - \\overline{x})^2 + \\ldots + (x_n - \\overline{x})^2}{n-1}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\displaystyle \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\overline{x})^2}{n-1}}\n","$$\n","\n","\n","This small correction we added to the sample standard deviation (dividing by $n-1$ instead of $n$) is called **Bessel's correction**.

The mean of the 5000 sample standard deviations without Bessel's correction is roughly 71304, while the mean standard deviation of the sample standard deviations having the correction is roughly 75161. This is significantly closer to the population standard deviation, which is approximately 79887.\n","\n","\n","We could decrease the denominator more (dividing by $n-2$ maybe) to try improving the correction. However, we need a single mathematical definition for the sample standard deviation, and we have to choose between $n$, $n-1$, $n-2$, etc. Remember that in practice we don't know the population standard deviation, so we can't tell which correction would work best for each sample standard deviation.\n","\n","Statisticians agree that $n-1$ is the best choice for the sample standard deviation formula, and we'll explore a strong argument in support of this in the next screen.\n","\n","Now that we have know what formulae to use for samples and populations, we introduce some standard notation that will help you understand other statistics resources.
